# EGBRNN: Explainable Gated Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Markov State Estimation

This repository is the official tensorflow implementation of [Explainable Gated Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network for Non-Markov State Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10508326).

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before running the code, please activate this conda environment.

## Data
We provide processed training and test data in the following paths (where the data in "Non-Markov series" can generated by "Non-Markov series/data/data_generate.py"):
~~~~
├── Aircraft tracking
   └── data
	   └── Train_data.npy
├── Non-Markov series
   └── data
   	   ├── all_gt.npy
	   └── all_noisy.npy
~~~~

If you want to start the experiments with raw flight records. 

For Aircraft tracking, you can download raw flight records with format "lt6" from the [open resource repository](https://c3.ndc.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/132/). 
The matlab and python programs used to process the raw data are in the following paths:
~~~~
├── Raw_data_processing
   ├── lt6_to_mat  #  Step 1. Matlab code for processing raw flight records in lt6 format.
   └── mat_to_npy  #  Step 2. Python code for processing data in mat format.
~~~~

For NCLT localization, you can download raw records from [NCLT dataset](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/). 

For lorenz attractor, you can generate the data as that in [KalmanNet](https://github.com/KalmanNet/KalmanNet_TSP).


## Training & Testing

The code for each experiment can be find in its corresponding folder. We finely commented the code for experiments Aircratf tracking and Non-Markov series. 
In each folder:

(1) to train the EGBRNN, please execute:
```Train_EGBRNN.py```

(2) to test the EGBRNN, please execute:
```Test_EGBRNN.py```

(3) gated network files:
```internal_gated.py```

<!-- ## Visualisation of Predicted Results
FlightLLM enables highly accurate trajectory prediction in line with flight dynamics.

## Uncertainty Quantification
FlightLLM can effectively measure the uncertainty of predictions.
